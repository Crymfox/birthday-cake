# Interactive Birthday Cake

Welcome to the Interactive Birthday Cake project! This project demonstrates creative front-end logic using React to simulate a birthday cake with dynamic decorations and interactive candles.

## Features

- **Dynamic Cake Decorations:** Little circles (cake decorations) are randomly distributed on the cake's surface every time the page is refreshed.
- **Interactive Candles:** 
  - Click on the cake's surface to drop a candle at the clicked position with a smooth animation using [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/).
  - Blow on your laptop's microphone to simulate blowing out the candles.
  - Click on the candle flame to toggle its status (on fire or not).
  - Click on the candle body to remove it from the cake.

## Key Binds

- **Space/Enter:** Set all candles aflame.
- **Escape:** Remove all candles from the cake.
